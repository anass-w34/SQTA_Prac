IDE Configuration: Your IDE might still be configured to use an older Java version, such as Java 8, despite having Java 21 installed. Please verify the following settings in your IDE:

Eclipse: Go to Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs and make sure Java 21 is selected as the default.
IntelliJ IDEA: Go to File > Project Structure > Project, and ensure both the Project SDK and Project language level are set to Java 21.

Add Java 21 JDK:

In the Installed JREs window (as shown in the screenshot), click on the Add... button on the right.
Select Standard VM and click Next.
In the JRE home field, navigate to the folder where Java 21 JDK is installed, which in your case is C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.

Right-click on your project in Eclipse.
Go to Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries.
Ensure that the JRE System Library points to Java 21. If it doesnâ€™t:
Select the existing JRE System Library and click Remove.
Click Add Library > JRE System Library > Alternate JRE > Select Java 21 > Finish
